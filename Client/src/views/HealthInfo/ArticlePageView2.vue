      AI analysis of 180 vape flavours finds that products contain 127 "acutely
      toxic" chemicals, 153 "health hazards" and 225 "irritants"<br /><br /></div>
      Chemicals used to produce vapes could be acutely toxic when heated and
      inhaled, according to research.<br /><br />

      Vaping devices heat the liquid flavouring to high temperatures to form an
      aerosol that is then inhaled. They contain chemicals including vegetable
      glycerin, propylene glycol, nicotine and flavourings, blended in various
      amounts.<br /><br />

      Previous experiments have shown that some fruit-flavoured vapes - such as
      strawberry, melon and blueberry - produce dangerous compounds called
      volatile carbonyls due to this heating process.<br /><br />

      These compounds are known to have health implications for chronic
      obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cardiovascular disease and
      cancers.<br /><br />

      With so many chemicals used in tens of thousands of different vape
      products, conducting experiments to test every brand and flavour for
      toxicity could take decades of research.<br /><br />

      produce 127 “acutely toxic” chemicals, 153 “health hazards” and 225
      “irritants”.<br /><br />

      Nearly every flavour put through the AI predictor showed at least one
      product that was classified as a health hazard, with many predicting
      several. The toxins were associated with vapes containing no nicotine, as
      well as those with.<br /><br />

      The research team at RCSI University of Medicine and Health Sciences,
      Dublin, conclude there is a “potential public health threat facing the 4.5
      million vapers in the UK” and an urgent need for “enhanced restrictions”
      on flavours and regulations that are reflective of the health risks of
      vaping, especially for young people.<br /><br />

      In January, the government announced that it would ban disposable vapes
      and restrict sweet and fruity flavours. Lead author Donal O'Shea,
      professor of chemistry at RCSI, said that the UK government should go
      further and remove all flavours from vapes.<br /><br />

      It is crucial to understand the impact of flavoured vapes on health
      “before it's too late”, he added.<br /><br />

      “It is plausible that we are on the cusp of a new wave of chronic diseases
      that will emerge 15 to 20 years from now due to these exposures.”<br /><br />

      Given the popularity of flavoured vapes among non-smoking teenagers and
      young adults, understanding the long-term effects of these products on
      public health, morbidity and mortality is crucial, the study concludes.<br /><br />

      “Without comprehensive regulation, as we try to treat the nicotine
      addictions of older tobacco smokers, there is a substantial risk of
      transferring new health issues to younger generations.”<br /><br />

      Responding to the findings, a Department of Health and Social Care
      spokesperson said: “The health advice is clear - if you don't smoke, don't
      vape and children should never vape.<br /><br />

      “That's why we are banning disposable vapes and our tobacco and vapes bill
      includes powers to limit flavours, packaging and displays of vapes to
      reduce the appeal to children.<br /><br />

      “It is clear that flavours like cotton candy and cherry cola are
      deliberately being targeted at children, not adult smokers trying to quit,
      which is completely unacceptable. That is why we are taking decisive
      action and will be restricting vape flavours.”<br /><br />

      Prof Sanjay Agrawal, the Royal College of Physicians' special adviser on
      tobacco, said that while vaping can be a very effective way to break the
      addiction to tobacco, it should only be used for this purpose.<br /><br />

      “Vaping is not risk-free, so those who don't smoke, including children and
      young people, should not vape either,” he said.<br /><br />

      John Dunne, director general at the trade body the UK Vaping Industry
      Association, said: “The science on vaping is very clear, it is the most
      effective way for smokers to quit and is at least 95% less harmful than
      smoking. Every chemical used in vaping e-liquid in the UK is stringently
      tested, including analysing chemicals when heated, and is only approved
      for use by the UK government if it is deemed safe.”<br /><br />
