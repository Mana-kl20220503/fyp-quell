      The message that vaping is 95% safer than smoking has backfired,
      encouraging some children to vape, says a top health expert.<br /><br />
      </div>

      Dr Mike McKean treats children with lung conditions and is vice-president
      for policy at the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health.<br /><br />

      He says the 2015 public messaging should have been clearer - vapes are
      only for adults addicted to cigarettes.<br /><br />

      Evidence on the possible health risks of vaping is still being
      gathered.<br />
      In an exclusive interview with the BBC, Dr McKean said: "Vaping is not for
      children and young people. In fact it could be very bad for you," although
      he stresses that it is not making lots of children very sick, and serious
      complications are rare.<br /><br />

      "Vaping is only a tool for adults who are addicted to cigarettes."<br /><br />

      He says the 95% safe messaging was "a very unwise thing to have done and
      it's opened the door to significant chaos".<br /><br />

      The "switch to vape" message has had an unintended consequence of driving
      children to take up e-cigs, he says.<br /><br />

      "There are many children, young people who have taken up vaping who never
      intended to smoke and are now likely addicted to vaping. And I think it's
      absolutely shocking that we've allowed that to happen.<br /><br />

      "It feels like we have put all our eggs in one basket and said 'this is
      the way to tackle cigarette smoking' and I feel we have neglected children
      and young people, by sort of embracing something almost too much without
      the real proper thought."<br /><br />

      Prof Ann McNeil was one of the co-authors of the original 2015 report and
      told the BBC that the advice was based on the literature at the time and
      what was known about what the products contained.<br /><br />

      "It was never intended to communicate that they're safe - it was intended
      to say there is a big difference in the harms."<br /><br />

      She says vaping is less risky than smoking, but children should not be
      doing it.<br /><br />

      The 95% safer figure is still used today by the vaping industry to promote
      its products.<br /><br />

      Doctors, public health experts, cancer charities and governments in the UK
      all agree that - based on the current evidence - e-cigarettes carry a
      fraction of the risk of cigarettes.<br /><br />

      The latest UK update on vaping and health published in 2022 says:<br /><br />

      in the short and medium term, vaping poses "a small fraction" of the risks
      of smoking vaping is not risk-free, particularly for people who have never
      smoked long-term effects or risks of vaping are unknown and need studying
      there is a lack of evidence on whether flavourings affect health risks the
      risk and severity of nicotine dependency from vaping is lower than for
      smoking but varies by product Like cigarettes, selling vapes to under-18s
      is illegal, but data suggests a growing number of young people are doing
      it.<br /><br />

      More than one in 10 people aged 16-24 said they were daily or occasional
      users in 2022, according to a survey carried out by the Office for
      National Statistics.<br /><br />

      Although vapes don't contain the same dangerous toxins as cigarettes, they
      do deliver a hit of addictive nicotine. Some teenage users say they are
      hooked. The BBC has been investigating youth vaping - recent tests on
      illegal vapes confiscated from a school found unsafe amounts of metals
      that could be inhaled into children lungs.<br /><br />

      Vaping - is it a risk-free option?<br />
      High lead and nickel found in illegal vapes<br />
      There is concern that young people are taking up vaping because they see
      it as completely risk-free.<br />

      Ian says he found his 13-year-old son smoking vapes and was horrified.<br /><br />

      "He's addicted to vaping and the more I looked into it the more I realised
      he is not alone.<br /><br />

      "I asked him why he does it and he says because it gives him a buzz, and
      that's how these addictions start."<br /><br />

      Prime Minister Rishi Sunak recently said it was "ridiculous" that vapes
      were designed and promoted to appeal to children when they were supposed
      to be used by adults giving up smoking.<br /><br />

      In Australia, vapes are only available on prescription.<br /><br />

      Smoking rates in the UK have been steadily falling in adults and children,
      both before and after vapes were introduced. Vaping can help smokers quit
      cigarettes.<br /><br />

      Mr Sunak is expected to announce measures soon aimed at cracking down on
      youth vaping in England. The Scottish and Welsh governments have already
      called for a ban on disposable vapes.
