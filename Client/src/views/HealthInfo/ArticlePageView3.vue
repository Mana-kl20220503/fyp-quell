      New RCSI research has uncovered the potentially harmful substances that
      are produced when e-liquids in vaping devices are heated for
      inhalation.<br /><br /></div>

      The study, published in Opens in new windowScientific Reports, highlights
      the urgent need for public health policies concerning flavoured vapes.
      <br /><br />

      The research team in RCSI’s Department of Chemistry used artificial
      intelligence (AI) to simulate the effects of heating e-liquid flavour
      chemicals found in nicotine vapes. They included all 180 known e-liquid
      flavour chemicals, predicting the new compounds formed when these
      substances are heated within a vaping device immediately prior to
      inhalation. <br /><br />

      The analysis revealed the formation of many hazardous chemicals including
      127 that are classified as ‘acute toxic’, 153 as ‘health hazards’ and 225
      as ‘irritants’. Notably, these included a group of chemicals called
      volatile carbonyls (VCs), which are known to pose health risks. Sources
      for VCs were predicted to be the most popular fruit, candy and
      dessert-flavoured products. <br /><br />

      Lead author Professor Donal O’Shea, Professor of Chemistry and Head of
      Department, said the findings are very concerning: “We wanted to
      understand, before it’s too late, the likely impact flavoured vapes are
      having on the health of the growing number of vapers. Our findings
      indicate a significantly different profile of chemical hazards compared to
      what we are familiar with from traditional tobacco smoking.<br /><br />

      “It is plausible that we are on the cusp of a new wave of chronic diseases
      that will emerge 15 to 20 years from now due to these exposures. We hope
      this research will help people make more informed choices and contribute
      to the conversation on the potential long-term health risks and the
      regulation of vaping, which this research suggests should be
      comprehensive.” <br /><br />

      The study also highlighted the complexities introduced by the huge array
      of flavours available in vaping products, which include 180 different
      chemicals blended in various amounts. This cocktail of chemicals,
      primarily derived from the food industry where they have a good safety
      record for specific uses, were never intended to be heated to high
      temperatures for inhalation. <br /><br />

      As vaping devices vary widely and are often user-customised, the
      temperature control and resulting chemical reactions can differ,
      increasing the unpredictability of potential health risks. This
      variability requires further research using the AI framework established
      in this study, which could also lead to the development of risk reports
      for individual flavours, providing an informative public health policy
      resource. <br /><br />

      Considering the popularity of flavoured vapes among non-smoking teenagers
      and young adults, understanding the long-term effects of these products on
      public health, morbidity and mortality is crucial. This study demonstrates
      that without comprehensive regulation, as we try to treat the nicotine
      addictions of older tobacco smokers, there is a substantial risk of
      transferring new health issues to younger generations. <br /><br />

      The research was carried out in conjunction with IBM Research – Tokyo and
      was supported by Science Foundation Ireland (SFI) and the Irish Research
      Council through the SFI-IRC Pathway Programme for Dr Dan Wu. Details are
      published in the paper Opens in new window‘Forecasting vaping health risks
      through neural network model prediction of flavour pyrolysis reactions’ in
      Scientific Reports.
